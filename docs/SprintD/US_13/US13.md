# US 13 - Consult the historical tests performed by a particular client
 
## 1. Requirements Engineering
 
*In this section, it is suggested to capture the requirement description and specifications as provided by the client as well as any further clarification on it. It is also suggested to capture the requirements acceptance criteria and existing dependencies to other requirements. At last, identfy the involved input and output data and depicted an Actor-System interaction in order to fulfill the requirement.* 
 
### 1.1. User Story Description
 
As a clinical chemistry technologist, I intend to consult the historical tests
performed by a particular client and to be able to check tests details/results.
 
### 1.2. Customer Specifications and Clarifications 


**From the specifications document:**
network of laboratories are then sent to the chemical laboratory located in the company headquarters and the chemical analysis are performed there.

**From the client clarifications:**
>
> Q: Should we show every client already registered when we show the clients' list to the clinical chemistry technologist or should we only show the clients' with a test or more already assigned?
>
> A: The system should show only clients that have tests already validated by the lab coordinator.

>
>Q: The client's tests, that we have to show on this US, need to have been validated by the lab coordinator or is it enough if they just have results and we can show them before being validated by the lab coordinator?
>
>A: The tests to be presented in US13 are tests that have already been validated by the lab coordinator.

>Q: From the user story description "As a clinical chemistry technologist, I intend to consult the historical tests performed by a particular client and to be able to check tests details/results". What do you mean by "check tests details/results" ?
>
>A: The clinical chemistry technologist should be able to check the historical tests performed by a particular client and see the results obtained in each test. For a given client (that was selected by the clinical chemistry technologist) the application should show all tests performed by the client and, for each parameter, the application should show the parameter value and the parameter reference values. The clinical chemistry technologist should not have access to the report made by the specialist doctor.

### 1.3. Acceptance Criteria

* **AC1:** : The application must allow ordering the clients by TIN and
           by name to help the clinical chemistry technologist choose the target client. The
           ordering algorithm to be used by the application must be defined through a
           configuration file. At least two sorting algorithms should be available

### 1.7 Other Relevant Remarks


The present US is held mainly in the beginning of the business a couple of times, as Clinical Analysis Laboratories are required for the business functioning in its very beginning. Apart from that, it will be held scarcely.

**The rationale grounds on the SSD interactions and the identified input/output data.**

| Interaction ID | Question: Which class is responsible for... | Answer  | Justification (with patterns)  |

### Systematization ##

According to the taken rationale, the conceptual classes promoted to software classes are: 

* Company  
* Laboratory  
* ClinicalAnalysisLaboratory  

Other software classes (i.e. Pure Fabrication) identified:

# 4. Tests 

Before starting to implement the tests, it was practical to **create a text fixture**, because most tests require a commmon set of objects. Therefore:  


# 6. Integration and Demo

To create a Clinical Analysis Laboratory, it is necessary to know the list of test types available in the system.  
Therefore, in order to reduce coupling, it was created a TestTypeDto as well as a TestTypeMapper to process the data and convert the list of test types to a Dto.  

**In Sprint C, it was added a ClinicalAnalysisLaboratoryStore** to reduce the responsabilities the Company has.  


# 7. Observations

Clinical Analysis Laboratory has many arguments passing through layers, therefore a DTO could make the maintenance easier.
