## Functionality

_Specifies functionalities that:_

* _are common across several US/UC;_
* _are not related to US/UC, namely: Audit, Reporting and Security._

### Audit
* “Considering that Many Labs has the exclusivity to perform Covid-19 tests, and that the contract with the NHS in England requires Many Labs to summarize and report Covid-19 data, the company needs to: identify the number of Covid-19 tests performed, identify all positive results to Covid-19 tests, report the total number of Covid-19 cases per day, per week and per month of the year and send the forecasts for these same time horizons (…)”

### Localization
* "The application must support the English language only." - It focus on the need of a specific language for the application, despite the location of the user. It has a different impact in the "Usability" in the subcategory "Consistency and standards".

### Email
* "The client receives the notification by SMS and e-mail."
* “Client receives a notification alerting that the results are already available in the central application"

In this context, the two points above refer that the application has the funcionality to send SMS and e-mail. It has a different impact in the "Others (+)" category, in the "Funcionality Constraints" subcategory.

### Printing
* "To facilitate the access to the results, when clients are listed they should be ordered by TIF number or name."

### Reporting
* "The company is also required to generate daily (automatic) reports with all the information demanded by the NHS and should send them to the NHS using their API." - In this context, it focus on the need for generating automatic reports. It has a different impact in the "Others (+)" category in the "Interface Constraints" subcategory.


## Usability 

### Help and documentation
* “Therefore, at least two sorting algorithms should be evaluated and documented in the application user manual (in the annexes) that must be delivered with the application.”
* “The time complexity analysis of the algorithms should be properly documented in the application user manual (in the annexes) that must be delivered with the application”
* “The accuracy of the prediction models should be analysed and documented in the application user manual (in the annexes) that must be delivered with the application.”

All three points above mention that the two sorting algorithms, the time complexity analysis of the algorithms and the accuracy of the prediction models, should be correctly and appropriately documented.
(Every point is already in Implementation Constrains (+))



* "The implemented (brute-force) algorithm should be analysed in terms of its worst-case time complexity, and it should be compared to a provided benchmark algorithm."
